Melanism in the genus Panthera
Melanism in the jaguar is conferred by a dominant allele, and in the leopard by a recessive allele.[5] Melanistic and non-melanistic animals can be littermates. It is thought that melanism confers a selective advantage under certain conditions since it is more common in regions of dense forest, where light levels are lower. Preliminary studies also suggest that melanism might be linked to beneficial mutations in the immune system.[6] Due to the excess black pigments, the typical spotted markings are present, but hidden, which is called "ghost rosettes".[7]

Frequency of melanism appears to be approximately 11% over the leopard's range. Data on the distribution of leopard populations indicates that melanism occurs in five subspecies in the wild: Javan leopard, African leopard (P. p. pardus), Indian leopard (P. p. fusca), Indochinese leopard (P. p. delacouri), Sri Lankan leopard (P. p. kotiya).[8] Black leopards are common in the equatorial rainforest of the Malay Peninsula and the tropical rainforest on the slopes of some African mountains such as Mount Kenya.[9] Melanistic leopards are common in Java, and are reported from densely forested areas in southwestern China, Myanmar, Assam and Nepal, from Travancore and some parts of southern India where they may be more numerous than spotted leopards.[10]

In North Africa, dark leopards have been reported in the Atlas Mountains.[11] A black leopard was sighted in the alpine zone of Mount Kenya.[12] Black leopards also occur in Kenya's Aberdare Mountains and in Ethiopia. Unconfirmed reports of black leopards exist also in South Africa and in northern Iran. Based on records from camera traps, melanistic leopards occur foremost in tropical and subtropical moist forests.[8] In 2019, a black leopard was recorded in Kenya's Laikipia County.[13][14]

The taxonomic status of captive black leopards and the extent of hybridization between the Javan leopard and other leopard subspecies is uncertain. Therefore, coordinated breeding programs for black leopards do not exist in European and North American zoos.[15] Black leopards occupy space needed for breeding endangered leopard subspecies and are not kept within the North American Species Survival Plan.[16][17]

Two black Amur leopard (P. p. orientalis) cubs were born in zoos.[18][19]

A pseudo-melanistic leopard has a normal background color, but the spots are more densely packed than normal and merge to obscure the golden-brown background color. Any spots on the flanks and limbs that have not merged into the mass of swirls and stripes are unusually small and discrete, rather than forming rosettes. The face and underparts are paler and dappled like those of ordinary spotted leopards.[20]

Jaguar

In 2009, a black jaguar was recorded for the first time in Costa Rica's Alberto Manuel Brenes Biological Reserve.[21] In the mountains of the Cordillera de Talamanca, 104 records of jaguars were obtained between 2010 and 2019; 26 of them showed melanistic jaguars.[22]

In jaguars, the melanism allele is dominant. Consequently, black jaguars have either black or spotted cubs, but a pair of spotted jaguars can only produce spotted cubs. Individuals with two copies of the allele are darker with a denser black background colour.[citation needed]
